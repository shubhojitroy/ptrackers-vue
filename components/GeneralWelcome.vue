          General Welcome – Chief Investment Officer of PM Capital (Investment Manager)
        </h1>        
        <p>
          It is an exciting time to be investing in global equities, with recent returns from international markets demonstrably stronger than returns from the Australian market. In fact, global equity markets have outperformed the Australian share market in four out of the five past years.  This may be because Australia is a relatively small market, concentrated in banks and resources companies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finding the best opportunities in global markets to build wealth requires experience, patience and conviction:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
               <strong>Experience</strong> is required to discover and divine the value of a market opportunity: 
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>Patience</strong> is needed to choose the best time to invest; and 
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>Conviction</strong> allows you to keep your head when all others may be losing theirs. 
            </li>   
        </ul>        
        <p>
          We are very pleased that PM Capital is the investment manager for GO 2025. We believe our benchmark-unaware philosophy and process, tested over 20 years and executed by one of the most experienced global equities teams in Australia, will allow us to continue to find market anomalies that can provide attractive long term returns.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our long term track record is attractive. Since its inception our longest-running global equities fund (the PM Capital Global Companies Fund (ARSN 092 434 618)) to 31 May 2018 has produced a return of 439.7% against an Index return  of 137.3% - an outperformance of 302.4%. This means that an investment of $100,000 at inception would now be worth $539,703, which is $302,400 more than if it was invested in the Index.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the team of PM Capital has significant personal investments in the funds and LICs that we manage, we see investors in GO 2025 as our co-investors, investing together to access a subset of global opportunities off the radar of most other managers. Our Insights section on the PM Capital website (pmcapital.com.au/insights) may give you a better understanding of why and how we buy stocks and manage the portfolio.
        </p>
        <p>
          GO 2025 combines the more than 120 years of total global investment management experience provided by the PM Capital team, with an innovative feature that allows holders of its securities – PTrackERS -  to access the NTA of the securities through an option to redeem in June 2025, notwithstanding where the security is trading at the redemption date, or to exchange them for Ordinary Shares of PGF.  In effect this unique feature gives security holders more flexibility and control. Chairman, Andrew McGill’s letter and the Prospectus further explains this feature.
        </p>        
        <p>
          We see it as very important that we communicate with our co-investors on investment matters, so please don’t hesitate to contact us.
