    <p>
      Dear Investors
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for considering an investment in GO 2025. We are pleased to offer this innovative way to invest in global equities.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that GO 2025 is unique in the Australian market, combining the skills of an exceptional global equities investment
      manager with an innovative offer structure that, uniquely for the listed investment company (LIC) sector, gives investors
      more control, choice and flexibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘GO 2025’ stands for ‘Global Opportunities’, reflecting its focus on global securities, and the year 2025, which is when
      its securities, called PTrackERS, will mature.
    </p>
    <p>
      GO 2025’s assets will be managed by PM Capital, a highly experienced and awarded global equities manager, using the same
      investment philosophy and process as utilised by the PM Capital Global Opportunities Fund (ASX:PGF).
    </p>
    <p>
      PM Capital offers an established philosophy and process and a highly experienced global equities investment team. Its founder,
      Chief Investment Officer and Portfolio Manager, Paul Moore, has been investing in global equities for 30 years and
      has delivered industry leading long term returns for investors<sup>1</sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
      PGF’s performance has been strong since its initial public offering, using the same strategy based on that of PM Capital’s
      unlisted managed funds and mandates. These unlisted funds have a significantly longer operating history and track-record
      than that of PGF, and have achieved the following industry-leading long term performance<sup>1</sup>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        As at 30 June 2017: 1<sup>st</sup> in its peer group over 3, 5, 7 and 8-year period.<sup>2</sup>
      </li>
      <li>
        as at 31 December 2017: 1<sup>st</sup> in its peer group over 5,6,7,8 and 9 years.<sup>3</sup>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As well as capital gains, GO 2025’s securities are targeting distributions at a yield of between 3% and 4% per annum plus
      franking as available.
    </p>
    <p>
      GO 2025 is also a next generation LIC, offering a unique way to give security holders more options. Since listing in 2013,
      PGF has observed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        even strongly performing LICs can trade away from their underlying net tangible asset (NTA) value, creating uncertainty for
        investors as to whether they can obtain the underlying value of their securities;
      </li>
      <li>
        growth in a LIC’s capital can lead to a dilution of NTA per share for existing holders and makes it more difficult to track
        investment manager performance; and
      </li>
      <li>
        while some investors look for long term capital growth, others seek certainty of distribution policy.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      GO 2025, through its PTrackERS securities, looks to solve the above concerns. PTrackERS, short for Portfolio Tracking Exchangeable
      Redeemable Security (Converting Security), are fully paid, unsecured exchanging securities. PTrackERS:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        are similar to traditional LIC securities in that have attributable NTA determined by the Portfolio’s investment performance;
      </li>
      <li>
        are innovative in that it provides holders with the ability to access the NTA of the securities through exercising their
        right to redeem in June 2025, notwithstanding where the security is trading at the Maturity Date.
      </li>
      <li>
        If not redeemed, automatically exchanged for Ordinary Shares of PGF in a manner which is highly equitable and non-dilutionary
        <u>to NTA before tax plus franking credits</u> for both PGF and PTrackERS holders; and
      </li>
      <li>
        have a target distribution yield<sup>1</sup> of between 3% and 4% per annum paid semi-annually.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each PTrackERS have an Issue Price of $1.40. The Entitlement Offer is expected to close on 8 August 2018, and the General
      Offer and Broker Firm Offer are expected to close on 10 August 2018. Nevertheless, the Offer may close early, so you
      are encouraged to submit your Application as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      With PM Capital’s experience and demonstrated performance, I believe GO 2025 offers an attractive opportunity to investors.
      I hope you will consider GO 2025 as part of your global investments.
