        WELCOME TO INVESTORS
      </h1>
      <h4>
        Dear Investors
      </h4>
      <p>
        On behalf of the Boards of PM Capital Global Opportunities Fund Limited (<strong><em>PGF</em></strong> or <strong><em>Parent Company</em></strong>) and PM Capital GO 2025 Limited (<strong><em>Company</em></strong>) (jointly the <strong><em>Issuers</em></strong>), I am pleased to offer you the opportunity to participate in a non-renounceable offer of redeemable, unsecured exchanging securities, named Portfolio Tracking Exchangeable Redeemable Securities (Converting Security) (<strong><em>PTrackERS</em></strong>) (<strong><em>Offer</em></strong>).
      </p>
      <h4>
        Background and purpose to the Offer
      </h4>
      <p>
        The Company is a newly incorporated and wholly owned subsidiary of PGF. PGF is a listed investment company (LIC) that is managed by PM Capital Limited (PM Capital or Investment Manager). PGF invests in a concentrated portfolio of global securities diversified across global equity markets (including Australia) with the objective of providing long-term capital growth over a 7-year plus investment period.<br><br>
        PGF, which has enjoyed strong performance since its initial public offering, has its investment strategy based on that of PM Capital’s unlisted managed funds and mandates. These unlisted funds have a significantly longer operating history and track-record than that of PGF, and have achieved the following industry leading long-term performance:<br><br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          as at 30 June 20171, the Colonial First State FirstChoice (CFS FC) PM Capital Wholesale Global Companies Fund ranked #1 in its Morningstar Australian Open-Ended Equity World Large Blend peer group of 176, 160, 144 and 143 over 3, 5, 7 and 8-year period respectively; and
        </li>
        <li>
          as at 31 December 20172, CFS FC-PM Capital Wholesale Global Companies Fund ranked #1 in its Morningstar Australian Open-Ended Equity World Large Blend peer group over 7 and 8 years out of 147 and 136 peers, respectively.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>
        PGF has observed that:
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          even strongly performing LICs, including PGF, can trade away from their underlying net tangible asset value, creating uncertainty for investors as to whether they can obtain the underlying value of their securities;
        </li>
        <li>
          growth in an LIC’s capital in pursuit of greater internal efficiencies, stock trading liquidity and market awareness is often associated with economic dilution of net tangible asset per share for existing holders and also adds complexity for investors wishing to track the underlying performance of the Investment Manager; and
        </li>
        <li>
          while some LIC investors focus purely on long term capital growth, others also seek certainty of distribution policy.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To address these issues, the Offer is being made as a new form of LIC securities know as a <strong><em>PTrackERS</em></strong>.
      </p>
      <h4>
        <em>PTrackERS</em>
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          similarly to traditional LIC securities, have attributable net tangible assets determined by the investment performance of the Portfolio purchased with the Offer proceeds;
        </li>
        <li>
          provides holders with a known time at which they can gain access to the net tangible asset performance underlying each <strong><em>PTrackERS</em></strong> through an option to redeem in June 2025;
        </li>
        <li>
          if not redeemed, be exchanged for fully-paid Ordinary Shares of PGF by way of an automatic exchange of <strong><em>PTrackERS</em></strong> for Ordinary Shares in a manner which is <u>non-dilutionary to NTA Before Tax Plus Franking Credits for both PGF shareholders and <strong><em>PTrackERS</em></strong> holders</u>; and
        </li>
        <li>
          have an attractive target yield of approximately 4% per annum.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By growing the size of issued capital, the Company and PGF consider that it will provide a positive stimulus to the marketability of PGF's securities generally, add to the liquidity of all securities on issue, increase scale, decrease per Share operating costs upon Exchange, and add to the researcher following of PGF. For more information on the nature of the LIC security, please see Section [6].
      </p>
      <h4>
        Overview of the Offer
      </h4>
      <p>
        Each <strong><em>PTrackERS</em></strong> will have an Issue Price of $[1.50]. On the maturity date of 30 June 2025 (or the last Business Day before where the Banks and the ASX are both open for trading in New South Wales) (<strong><em>Maturity Date</em></strong>), the <strong><em>PTrackERS</em></strong> will mandatorily be exchanged for fully-paid Ordinary Shares of PGF by way of an automatic exchange of <strong><em>PTrackERS</em></strong> for Ordinary Shares at an Exchange price which will be set by reference to the formula set out in Section [6], unless a redemption election at the option of the Securityholder has been exercised. The number of Shares that each <strong><em>PTrackERS</em></strong> will be exchanged for will be determined by reference to the net tangible assets attributable to each <strong><em>PTrackERS</em></strong> and the Shares such that Exchange is non-dilutionary to Net Tangible Assets Before Tax plus Franking for both <strong><em>PTrackERS</em></strong> holders and Shareholders.<br><br>
        <strong><em>PTrackERS</em></strong> are fully paid, unsecured exchanging securities. They are intended to pay Distributions at a yield of approximately 4% per annum of NTA After Tax Liabilities But Before Tax Assets, plus franking (where franking is available). For more information on the payment of Distributions, please see Section [3.1.2].<br><br>
        The Offer is not underwritten. However, the Issuers (through their Lead Managers) may seek to place any shortfall not taken up within three months.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Entitlement Offer
      </h4>
      <p>
        As part of the Offer, Eligible Shareholders of PGF will be entitled to subscribe for 1 <strong><em>PTrackERS</em></strong> for every 1 Share held as at [date] (<strong><em>Record Date</em></strong>) (<strong><em>Entitlement Offer</em></strong>). Details of the Entitlement Offer are set out in Section [2.2]. No assurance is given that any Shareholder Applicant will receive an allocation of <strong><em>PTrackERS</em></strong>.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Conclusion
      </h4>
      <p>
        The Company expects to be readily able to meet all financial commitments under the <strong><em>PTrackERS</em></strong> (i.e. to pay Distributions and to redeem the <strong><em>PTrackERS</em></strong> as and when required under the Trust Deed). It is the intention of the Company that the <strong><em>PTrackERS</em></strong> will be quoted on the ASX, with the ASX code: <strong>P25PA</strong>.<br><br>
        The Offer, including the Entitlement Offer, is scheduled to close on [date]. The key dates of the Offer are summarised on page [X]. The Offer may close early, so you are encouraged to submit your Application as soon as possible after the Opening Date.<br><br>
        On behalf of the Directors, I encourage you to read this Prospectus carefully. The terms of the <strong><em>PTrackERS</em></strong> are more complex than a simple debt instrument or ordinary equity instrument. In particular, you should consider the risk factors set out in Section [7] before deciding whether to apply for <strong><em>PTrackERS</em></strong>.<br><br> 
        If, after reading this Prospectus, you have any questions about the Offer or how to apply, please call PM Capital on +612 8243 0888 within Australia or 0800 222 143 within New Zealand, or consult your stockbroker, solicitor, accountant or other independent and qualified professional adviser.<br><br> 
        On behalf of the Board and management team of the Company and PGF, I invite you to consider this investment opportunity.
