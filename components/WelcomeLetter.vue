          Welcome letter – From the Issuer
        </h1>
        <h4>
          Dear Investors
        </h4>
        <p>
          Thank you for considering an investment in GO 25. We are pleased to offer this innovative way to invest in global equities.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that GO 25 is unique in the Australian market, combining the skills of an exceptional global equities investment manager with an innovative offer structure that (uniquely for the listed investment company (LIC) sector) is designed to be in the interests of investors.
        </p>
        <p>
          'GO 25' stands for 'Global Opportunities', reflecting its focus on global securities, and the year 2025, which is when its securities, called <span style="font-weight:500; font-style:oblique;">PTrackERS</span>, will mature.
        </p>
        <p>
          GO 25's assets will be managed by PM Capital, a highly experienced and awarded global equities manager, using the same investment philosophy and process as utilised by the PM Capital Global Opportunities Fund (ASX:PGF). PGF has enjoyed strong performance since its initial public offering by investing in a concentrated portfolio of global securities diversified across global equity markets (including Australia) with the objective of providing long term capital growth over a 7-year plus investment period.
        </p>
        <p>
          PM Capital offers an established philosophy and process and a highly experienced global equities investment team. Its founder, Chief Investment Officer and Portfolio Manager, Paul Moore, has been investing in global equities for 30 years and has delivered industry leading long term returns for investors<sup>1</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
          PGF’s performance has been strong since its initial public offering, using the same strategy based on that of PM Capital’s unlisted managed funds and mandates. These unlisted funds have a significantly longer operating history and track-record than that of PGF, and have achieved the following industry-leading long term performance<sup>1</sup>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            As at 30 June 2017: 1<sup>st</sup> in its peer group over 3, 5, 7 and 8-year period.<sup>2</sup>
          </li>
          <li>
            as at 31 December 2017: 1<sup>st</sup> in its peer group over 5,6,7,8 and 9 years.<sup>3</sup>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          GO 25 is meant principally to deliver capital growth. However, as well as capital gains, GO 25’s securities are targeting a distributions   at a yield of approximately 4%per annum plus franking as available.
        </p>
        <p>
          GO 25 offers the experience and track record of PM Capital. It is also a next generation LIC, offering a unique way to give security holders more options.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since listing in 2013, PGF has observed:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            even strongly performing LICs, including PGF, can trade away from their underlying net tangible asset value, creating uncertainty for investors as to whether they can obtain the underlying value of their securities;
          </li>
          <li>
            growth in an LIC’s capital is often associated with economic dilution of net tangible asset per share for existing holders and also adds complexity for investors wishing to track the underlying performance of the Investment Manager; and
          </li>
          <li>
            while some LIC investors focus purely on long term capital growth, others also seek certainty of distribution policy.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          GO 25, through its <span style="font-weight:500; font-style:oblique;">PTrackERS</span> securities, looks to solve the above concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
          PTrackERS, short for Portfolio Tracking Exchangeable Redeemable Security (Converting Security), are fully paid, unsecured exchanging securities. <span style="font-weight:500; font-style:oblique;">PTrackERS</span> are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            similarly to traditional LIC securities, have attributable net tangible assets determined by the investment performance of the portfolio purchased with the Offer proceeds;
          </li>
          <li>
            give holders the right to elect to redeem on 30 June 2025 at a value determined by reference to the net tangible value of the underlying investment portfolio;
          </li>
          <li>
            if not redeemed, be exchanged for fully-paid ordinary shares of PGF by way of an automatic exchange of <strong><em>PTrackERS</em></strong> in a manner which is <u>non-dilutionary to NTA before tax plus franking credits for both PGF shareholders and <strong><em>PTrackERS</em></strong> holders</u>; and
          </li>
          <li>
            have a target distribution yield1 of between 3% and 4% per annum paid semi-annually.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each security will have an issue price of $1.40. The Offer is expected to close on 10 August 2018. Nevertheless, it may closer early, so you are encouraged to submit your Application as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         With PM Capital’s experience and demonstrated performance, I believe GO 25 offers an attractive opportunity to investors. I hope you will consider GO 25 as part of your global investments.
