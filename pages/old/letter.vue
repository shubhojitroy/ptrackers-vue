            Dear Investor,
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the last decade shareholders have been asking us to establish a listed investment company (LIC) that provides exposure
            to undervalued international growth companies selected under the Wilson Asset Management investment strategy.
            We are pleased to offer this exclusive investment opportunity to investors. The initial public offer (IPO) capital
            raising is strictly limited to $550 million, 30% of which is the Priority Allocation to the Wilson Asset Management
            Family.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our 20-year track record of delivering strong risk-adjusted returns for investors has been driven by the quality of our people
            and their commitment to our proven investment strategy. Our 10 investment professionals have well over 100 years'
            combined experience and work as a close team focused on growing and protecting shareholders' capital.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our investment team invests across the full spectrum of the Australian equity market using our proven investment process,
            from micro-cap to large-cap companies. The information gathering and sharing drives risk-adjusted outperformance
            across all of our LICs. We are therefore incredibly excited to be adding a global LIC and team that will benefit
            from and contribute to our existing LICs' performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            WAM Global will take advantage of the two drivers of Wilson Asset Management's success - our people and our process. Lead
            Portfolio Manager Catriona Burns is an exceptional global fund manager who knows our process intimately. As Wilson
            Asset Management's second employee, Catriona helped develop our investment strategy between 2003 and 2007 before
            she left for London to manage global equities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our investment team is supported by high performing marketing and communications, finance and operations teams that deliver
            shareholders transparency, insights and experiences and we look forward to offering this service to WAM Global
            shareholders.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe WAM Global will deliver strong risk-adjusted returns derived from a high quality diversified portfolio of international
            equities. I will personally invest $5.5 million in the IPO which will be subject to scale back should the offer
            be oversubscribed.
          </p>

          <p>
            I hope you will join me as a shareholder in WAM Global, if you have any questions about WAM Global please contact me or Head
            of Corporate Affairs James McNamara on (02)&nbsp;9247&nbsp;6755.
